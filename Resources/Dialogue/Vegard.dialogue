Ingrid: [[Hi|Hello|Greetings]], I have urgent news.
Ingrid: Haugesund is changing rapidly.
Ingrid: A dictator is slowly taking control of more areas across the city.
Ingrid: The local council has been dissolved, and checkpoints have appeared overnight.

Ingrid: Do you want to know more about what's happening?
- Tell me which areas are affected
	Ingrid: It started near the harbor. Now, Skåredalen and parts of sentrum are under military presence.
	Ingrid: People are afraid to speak out. Surveillance is everywhere.
- Who is this dictator?
	Ingrid: His name is Arman Kell. No one voted for him, but he's gaining control through fear and silence.
	Ingrid: He uses propaganda and unknown forces to tighten his grip.
- What can we do?
	Ingrid: Right now? Stay informed, stay careful, and speak only to those you trust.
	Ingrid: Resistance may come—but not yet.

Ingrid: Be safe. These times are dangerous.
